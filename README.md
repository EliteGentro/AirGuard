AirGuard 

AirGuard is a smart home monitoring project featuring a physical prototype of a house equipped with a multi-layered sensor system. The project utilizes both Arduino and ESP32 modules, which communicate locally to distribute processing tasks and manage complexity effectively. The Arduino handles basic sensor inputs, while the ESP32 manages data aggregation and communication with a cloud database. A React-based website visualizes the data through dynamic graphs and provides real-time insights. The system also includes automated responses to hazardous conditions, ensuring safety and control. This architecture separates complexity and isolates tasks, offering a scalable and production-ready solution.
