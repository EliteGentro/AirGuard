# AirGuard

AirGuard is a smart home monitoring project featuring a physical prototype of a house equipped with sensors to detect environmental conditions. Sensor data is collected by an ESP32 module and transmitted to a cloud database. A React-based website visualizes the data through dynamic graphs and provides real-time insights. The system also includes automated responses to hazardous conditions, enhancing safety and control within the home environment.
